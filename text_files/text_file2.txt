Once upon a time, in a small mountain village, there lived a boy named Arun
who dreamed of flying. Every day, he watched the birds soar above the peaks
and wished he could join them. One day, Arun built a pair of wings from bamboo
and cloth. After many attempts and failures, he finally managed to glide down
a gentle hill, feeling the wind lift him for a brief, magical moment.
His determination inspired the whole village to pursue their own dreams.
