In a distant city, a young girl named Mira loved to paint. She saw beauty in 
the everyday scenes around her and captured them on canvas. One rainy afternoon,
she painted a mural on the wall of her school, turning a dull corridor into a 
vibrant garden. Her artwork brought smiles to everyone who passed by, and soon, 
other students joined her, filling the school with color and creativity.
Miraâ€™s passion showed everyone the power of imagination and art.
